# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3rd, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Did my 4th project on FreeCodeCamp(Technical Documentation Page) https://janm2001.github.io/Technical-doc-page/ , Finished ES6 Javascript and got really confused with this new things and had to ask for hint most of the times

**Thoughts:** I did not have much imagination today how to build this project and was a bit lazy and exited for the final project where I know what I want to build, so I just did it similar to the example but I manage to did it a bit my way and I could not figure out how to do scroll my navbar links. Since I did not understand Javascript lesson about ES6 so much I will take more time in the future to understand what code does and why...
